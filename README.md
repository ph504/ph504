## Introduction

Born on August 8th, 1998, in Shiraz, Iran.

### Bio
Hi, I am currently an MSc. student in computer science at the University of New Brunswick. I have been graduated from Shahid Beheshti University with a BSc. Degree in computer engineering in summer 2022. I have a keen interest in Robotics, Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning, and Computer Vision. 

I am working currently on NAO and Jackal robots!

In my bachelor's degree, I have worked with mechanical arms and mobile robots, experienced various problems, and enjoyed solving them in my internship and my bachelor's thesis. Since physical systems are too expensive to work with, I focused on developing my robotic projects with the powerful Webots robot simulator, which I used in all my robotics-related projects. I am enthusiastic about sharing what I learn with my underclassmen. On a side note, I also program games for fun.
